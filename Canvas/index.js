 * This example creates a path with a number of horizontal line segments and
   then strokes it using the stroke method. Each segment created with lineTo
   starts at the pathâ€™s current position.
   That position is usually the end of the last segment, unless moveTo was called. In that case, the next segment would
   start at the position passed to moveTo .
